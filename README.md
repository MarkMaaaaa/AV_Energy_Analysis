# AV_Energy_Analysis
This repository contains the dataset and code for our study on automated vehicle (AV) energy consumption modeling. The AV-Micro model, which is specifically designed to improve energy consumption prediction for AVs, is implemented here alongside traditional VT-Micro and ARRB models.
